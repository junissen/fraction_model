# fraction_model
Python Rayleigh fractionation model that loops over model parameters to estimate fraction of moisture remaining depending on source and local temperature change

Rayleigh fractionation model that varies source and local temperature change to estimate the change in fraction of moisture remaining depending on local d18O of precipitation or d18O of calcite. To run model for Last Glacial Maximum conditions in Spring Valley, MN, run Fraction_model_run.py. To run model for last interglacial conditions in Spring Valley, MN, run Fraction_model_run_interglacial.py.
